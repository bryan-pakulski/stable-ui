# TODO: types.h
initialise string with a maximum length, this is important as if we reload configuration by
editing the string manually via ImGui we don't have the hooks to re-size memory and we risk overwriting if
the initial string is too short

Optional flag for half size generation (lower memory usage at the cost of longer inference time)
