# Main canvas window
Split canvas window into 512x512 grid of textures expanding "infinitely"

Allow for mouse interaction (zoom in / out)

Allow for scrolling with middle mouse button clicks

Allow for selection with mouse click (up to max pixel size i.e. 512x512 for img2img inpainting)

Allow for right click and drag erase functionality (no undo support as of yet)

Allow for saving to a file, using grid detection, grids should grow / shrink dynamically if they contain data or are empty

Use wor;d coordinates system


# TODO: types.h
initialise string with a maximum length, this is important as if we reload configuration by
editing the string manually via ImGui we don't have the hooks to re-size memory and we risk overwriting if
the initial string is too short

Optional flag for half size generation (lower memory usage at the cost of longer inference time)

Add support for textual inversion, see: https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-fine-tune-stable-diffusion-using-textual-inversion-b995d7ecc095
