Allow for mouse interaction (zoom in / out)

Allow for selection with mouse click (up to max pixel size i.e. 512x512 for img2img inpainting)

Allow for right click and drag erase functionality (no undo support as of yet)

# TODO: types.h
initialise string with a maximum length, this is important as if we reload configuration by
editing the string manually via ImGui we don't have the hooks to re-size memory and we risk overwriting if
the initial string is too short

# Additional
Add support for textual inversion, see: https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-fine-tune-stable-diffusion-using-textual-inversion-b995d7ecc095
