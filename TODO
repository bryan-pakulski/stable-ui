# Main canvas window

Allow for selection with mouse click (up to max pixel size i.e. 512x512 for img2img inpainting)

Allow for right click and drag erase functionality (no undo support as of yet)

Allow for saving to a file, using grid detection, grids should grow / shrink dynamically if they contain data or are empty

Load module progress bar

# TODO: types.h

initialise string with a maximum length, this is important as if we reload configuration by
editing the string manually via ImGui we don't have the hooks to re-size memory and we risk overwriting if
the initial string is too short

This can potentially be resolved by using std::string as a resizable datatype, see imgui_stdlib.h

# Additional

Add support for textual inversion, see: https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-fine-tune-stable-diffusion-using-textual-inversion-b995d7ecc095

Delete models & configurations

Save output to temporary folder - "gen??" This way you can generate multiple item etc.. and move them automatically after generation is finished to an output folder

Ping Pong between server & client to ensure nothing has gone wrong mid command? perhaps do this over a seperate port?

Add input sanitisation on sd_client on messages being sent, delimit or convert " to '?
